# KANMASU
### 漢マス：Kanji Memorization Tool

## FEATURES
### 作 CREATE CARD
The create card functionality allows you to create a custom flashcard, using inputs for Kanji, Hiragana, and the Definition. Create card will automatically translate your Hiragana into Romaji, so this is a good tool for beginners as well.

### 見 VIEW ALL CARDS
The view all cards functionality allows for you to view all your currently created cards, as well as delete any cards that you may have created. 

### 練 PRACTICE DECK
The practice deck functionality allows for you to practice your current deck. You can cycle through all the cards you have created, and it automatically randomizes the order in which you get the cards shown to you. It will show you the Kanji, Hiragana, and Romanji readings, but hide the definition from you, until you click on the card.

### 保 SAVE DECK
The save deck functionality allows for you to save the current deck. It will save it as an encrypted .kms (kanmasu) file, which can only be de-encrypted using the Kanmasu application.

### 読 LOAD DECK
The load deck functionality allows for you to load any previously created decks. It only accepts .kms (kanmasu) files, and will de-encrypt and load the deck properly.
